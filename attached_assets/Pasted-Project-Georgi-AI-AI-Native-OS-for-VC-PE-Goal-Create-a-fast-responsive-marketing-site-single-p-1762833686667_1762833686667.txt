Project: Georgi AI — AI-Native OS for VC/PE Goal: Create a fast, responsive marketing site (single page) with a sticky top nav, dark theme, subtle gradient accents, and clean typography. Brand vibe: Modern VC + trustworthy fintech. Dark slate background, soft indigo/blue accents, lots of white space, rounded cards, gentle shadows. Components: • Sticky Nav: Logo “Georgi”, links = Product, Problem, Features, Why Georgi, Team, Contact. “Book a demo” CTA (button). • Hero (split): Headline, sub-headline, 2 CTAs, trust badges. Right side: animated mock or dashboard image placeholder. • Problem → Solution: Two-column; bullets for “Fragmented, Manual, Error-Prone” and “Unified, Automated, Secure.” • Product Sections (3): “AI-Native ERP”, “Operations & Compliance”, “Analytics & Copilot” — each with icon, 3 bullets, and “Learn more” link (anchor). • Social Proof / Market: TAM stats row and small client logos placeholder. • Competitive Comparison: compact table (Georgi vs. Carta, Aduro, Hanover Park, AngelList, Sydecar) with ✅/🟡/❌. • Architecture callout: small diagram card: “AI-native ERP + Vector DB + SQL + Document parsing.” • ICP section: Primary & Secondary buyers, Decision makers. • Team: Two founder cards with short bios. • CTA band: “Book a demo” + email capture. • Footer: Contact (tj@georgi.ai ), link to georgi.ai/demo, social placeholders. Design details: – Dark slate #0B1220 background; cards #0F172A; accents #5562FF and #7C3AED; text #E5E7EB/#94A3B8. – Use system font stack or Inter; large, confident headings; generous spacing; rounded-2xl cards. – Smooth scroll, accessible contrast, mobile-first. Content: Use the exact copy below. Performance: Compress images, lazy-load media, ship semantic HTML, add meta tags (title, description, OG/Twitter). Actions: Include a working “Book a demo” form (email + firm name + AUM range) that POSTs to a placeholder endpoint /api/demo; show success toast. Add Calendly/link placeholder. Export: Provide clean HTML/CSS (Tailwind acceptable) or Next.js page with components. Keep sections as anchors.
